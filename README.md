# AI-Powered-Knowledge-Management-System-using-RAG

This project is an AI-Powered Knowledge Management System built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It allows practitioners to upload domain-specific knowledge in the form of PDF files, enabling academic researchers to ask tailored questions and receive AI-generated responses based on the content of those PDFs. The system leverages state-of-the-art NLP techniques to bridge the gap between academic research and practical application, particularly in the field of strategic management.
